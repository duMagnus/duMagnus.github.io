Resumix is an app that lets you record audio and get a summary of what was said in just a few seconds and it also stores the transcription of the audio so you can always go back for any details. Whether you want to capture the main points of a lecture, a meeting, or a podcast, it can help save time and keep things organized. It uses the OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe audio into text, and then the GPT API to generate a concise and accurate summary.",

The first one was with my (mostly) original algorithm from the school project, with preloaded words and an algorithm to randomly pick one and shuffle it. The second one was offsetting the processing all to openAI. I managed to not only get a new random word from them, but in any language, in json formatting and shuffled.",
